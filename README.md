# zSys

## Introduction

> zSys is (yet another) build system based around recursive make! It also integrates the Unity and Cmock libraries written by throwtheswitch (https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch)

## Code Samples

> The general idea behind zSys is to allow developers to easily be able to build and deploy a system that provides functionality through the use of shared objects. This easily allows architectures to be split across various components or libraries, where components are owned by the developer and libraries contain third party libraries that are pulled in and built by the zSys buildsystem.

## Installation

> There are currently no installation instructions, simply clone the git repo and have a browse around.

## Usage

> Once the zSys repo has been cloned, the build environment must be setup.
> Run `source buildsys/common/env.sh <TARGET> <DISTRIBUTION>` to setup the build environment
> for example, to setup the `native-unittest` environment set target to `native` and distribution to `unittest`

NOTE: There only exists the native-unittest environment.
